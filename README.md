## Summary
Twitter Showcase is a single page application (SPA) that allows the user to search Twitter for tweets by topic or from a specific user. The user can also view a random tweet from several preselected accounts. The primary purpose of this project is to serve as a learning tool to familiarize myself with APIs. In addition, this project has helped me create foundational skills in React and Express.
